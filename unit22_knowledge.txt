Knowledge Base for AI Marking and Feedback
LO1: Understand the scope and challenges of Big Data
P1: To achieve a Pass, the student must outline what is meant by Big Data. The student should describe the Big Four characteristics: volume, variety, velocity, and veracity. For each characteristic, the student should provide a brief explanation. For example, volume refers to the scale or amount of data, variety refers to the different forms of data, velocity refers to the speed at which data is generated and analysed, and veracity refers to the uncertainty or reliability of data. The student should include at least one example to illustrate these characteristics, such as a stock exchange generating large amounts of data or a streaming service processing gigabytes of data per hour. The explanation should be clear, accurate, and show a basic understanding of the concept.
M1: For Merit, the student must explain how Big Data can be used. The explanation should go beyond simply outlining the characteristics of Big Data and should include descriptive examples of its uses in different sectors or scenarios. The student should describe the purpose and reasons for using Big Data, such as uncovering hidden patterns, identifying unknown correlations, predicting market trends, and understanding customer preferences. The student should show how Big Data is applied in real-world contexts, for example, how businesses use it for personalised recommendations, how manufacturers use it for predictive maintenance, or how organisations use it for data-driven decision-making. The explanation should demonstrate an understanding of the benefits of Big Data, such as improved efficiency, better decision-making, and competitive advantage. The student should also show awareness of the technologies and methods used to analyse Big Data, such as data mining, machine learning, and advanced analytics.
P2: For Pass, the student must explain the impacts that the use of Big Data could have on different organisations. The student should describe how Big Data is used in organisations and what the impacts are, such as improving customer experience, enabling targeted marketing, increasing revenue, or supporting better decision-making. The explanation should include why these uses result in these impacts. For example, using customer data to personalise recommendations can lead to increased sales and customer loyalty. The student should provide examples from business, healthcare, education, or other sectors to support their explanation.
D1: For Distinction, the student must evaluate the infrastructure challenges faced by organisations that use and process Big Data. The evaluation should demonstrate a deep understanding of the technical and organisational difficulties that arise when collecting, storing, processing, and managing massive amounts of data. The student should discuss capacity issues, including the need for scalable storage and processing solutions, such as distributed analytics and cloud storage. They should address virtualisation, capacity allocation, and the use of analytical software. The student must consider scalability, showing how organisations adapt their infrastructure to handle increasing volumes and complexity of data. The evaluation should include qualitative judgements, weighing the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches, and referencing real-world examples of how organisations overcome these challenges. The student should also consider security, governance, and compliance issues, and discuss how these impact the effectiveness and reliability of Big Data infrastructure.
LO2: Be able to process Big Data for business purposes
P3: For Pass, the student must select appropriate sources of Big Data for a specified business purpose and provide a rationale for the choices made. The student should identify at least two sources of Big Data, such as social media content, web server logs, or machine data from sensors. For each source, the student should explain why it is suitable for the business purpose, such as using social media data to understand customer preferences or using sensor data to monitor equipment performance. The rationale should be clear and relevant to the business scenario.
P4: For Pass, the student must suggest possible risks associated with the selected Big Data sources. The student should identify at least two risks, such as data cleansing issues, data validity, data reliability, legislative risks (e.g. data protection), or ethical risks (e.g. privacy concerns). For each risk, the student should provide a brief explanation of what it is and how it could affect the business. The student may also suggest basic ways to reduce these risks, such as ensuring data is accurate or complying with data protection laws.
M2: For Merit, the student must make recommendations for eradicating risks associated with the selected Big Data sources identified in P4. The recommendations should be specific and practical, focusing on how the data should be managed from selection through to processing. The student should address issues such as data cleansing, coding, validity, and integrity, and suggest ways to ensure data quality and reliability. The recommendations should include strategies for managing legislative and ethical risks, such as compliance with data protection laws, staff training on data privacy, and the implementation of consent protocols. The student should also consider technical solutions, such as encryption, multi-layered cybersecurity, and real-time monitoring systems, as well as organisational measures like regular audits and data governance frameworks. The recommendations should be tailored to the context of the selected data sources and show an understanding of how to minimise or eradicate risks throughout the data lifecycle.
P5: For Pass, the student must process Big Data from the selected sources to meet the purpose of the business. The student should demonstrate the preparation and processing techniques used to obtain results, such as cleansing the data, coding, and analysing it using appropriate methods. The evidence should show the initial data prior to preparation, the data after preparation, and the results of processing, which may be presented in tables, charts, or graphs. The student should show how the data was questioned and analysed to produce meaningful results for the business scenario.
D2: For Distinction, the student must evaluate the outcomes based on the preparation and processing of the Big Data analytic carried out in P5. The evaluation should show that the student has made qualitative judgements, taking into account different factors and using available knowledge, experience, and evidence. The student should assess whether the identified solution meets the requirements and customer needs, and analyse the strengths of the Big Data analytic. The evaluation should include a discussion of limitations, areas for improvement, and recommendations for future action. The student should demonstrate advanced understanding by considering how the results inform business decisions and strategy, and by suggesting improvements to the analytic process, such as the adoption of predictive analytics, machine learning, or more robust data governance. The student should use visual representations, such as graphs and charts, to support their evaluation, ensuring that labelling is accurate and clear. The evaluation should be comprehensive, reflecting on the effectiveness, reliability, and business impact of the Big Data solution.
LO3: Be able to provide information resulting from processing Big Data
P6: For Pass, the student must present information as a result of processing Big Data for a business purpose. The presentation may be in the form of a report, video, presentation with speaker notes, or visualisation such as charts or graphs. The student should ensure that graphs and charts are accurately labelled and suitable for the intended audience. The student should state who the audience is and ensure the style of presentation meets their needs. The presentation should clearly communicate the results of the Big Data analysis and be appropriate for the business context.
M3: For Merit, the student must make recommendations to the business arising from the processing of Big Data. The recommendations should reflect improvements to business processes and/or changes to the focus for future activities. The student should use the results of their data analysis to suggest actionable steps the business can take, such as adopting new data strategies, investing in scalable infrastructure, improving data quality management, or enhancing ethical governance. The recommendations should be clear, relevant, and justified by the evidence from the student’s own analysis. The student should also consider how these recommendations could help the business achieve its goals, respond to challenges, or take advantage of new opportunities.
