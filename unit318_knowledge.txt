Unit 318 – Software Installation and Upgrade
BTEC Level 3 NVQ
Assessment Criteria & Guidance
1.1 Describe the software installation and upgrade process including:
The process for installing and upgrading software begins with obtaining proper authorisation. For example, this may involve an email from a manager or a signed installation plan. Failing to secure authorisation can result in unauthorised changes or security breaches. Before proceeding, it is essential to check the hardware specifications of the target system. This can be demonstrated with a screenshot of the system specifications or a reference to the minimum requirements for the software. Data should always be backed up prior to installation, and evidence of this can include a screenshot of the backup process or a backup log. A risk assessment must be performed, and a completed risk assessment form should be included as evidence.
The installation itself typically involves a series of wizard screens, such as agreeing to the licence agreement, entering the licence key, selecting the installation folder, observing the progress bar as files are copied, creating shortcuts, and configuring the new software. It is important to be aware of software licensing regulations, which can be evidenced by a screenshot of the licence key entry or a summary of the licence terms. Practical evidence for this criterion may include emails requesting authorisation, a completed installation plan, a screenshot from a ticket system, or a risk assessment form.
For information recording, it is important to keep accurate records of all installations. This can be done using a ticket system, a paper or online record, or an Excel log. The information recorded should include the date and time of installation, licence keys, software version, and the devices involved. Record keeping is important because it helps technical support diagnose issues in the future. Practical evidence may include a screenshot of the ticket system, a completed installation log, or an email confirmation.
When considering software storage locations, the default locations are typically C:\Program Files or C:\Program Files (x86). However, software may also be installed on partitioned drives or separate hardware or servers. The choice of location is important for reasons such as security and access. Evidence for this may include a screenshot of the installation folder or an annotated diagram of storage locations.
To address software specifications, you should know where to find them, such as on the publisher’s website or in the software properties. Key details to look for include the publisher, title, version, licence, installation location, operating system, minimum RAM, storage space, and processor requirements. Practical evidence may include a screenshot of the software properties or a specification sheet.
Examples for this criterion include an email requesting authorisation for installation, a screenshot of Windows 10 system requirements, a completed risk assessment form for Windows 10 installation, screenshots of installation wizard screens such as the licence agreement and folder selection, and a screenshot of an installation log in Excel.
1.2 Describe the capabilities of software loading facilities
Software can be installed using a variety of loading facilities, including CD or DVD, solid state drive or hard disk, internet download, and USB memory stick. For each method, you should be able to provide images, describe the capacity and typical speeds, and discuss the advantages and disadvantages. Practical evidence may include images or screenshots of each facility and a comparison table of speeds and capacities.
Examples for this criterion include a photo of a USB stick used for installation, a screenshot of the download speed for a software installer, and a table comparing CD/DVD, USB, and download methods.
2.1 Provide guidance on installation or upgrade procedures to immediate colleagues
You should be able to create a step-by-step guide for installing or upgrading at least two pieces of software, with at least one being an upgrade and one being an operating system. Each step should be explained and accompanied by screenshots. You must also complete an installation plan and a risk assessment. Practical evidence includes an annotated guide, screenshots, and completed plans and assessments.
Examples include a guide with screenshots for upgrading Windows 7 to Windows 10, a guide for installing Microsoft Office with annotated steps, a completed installation plan for Windows 10, and a completed risk assessment for Windows 10 installation.
2.2 Obtain and allocate required materials
To obtain and allocate the required materials for software installation, you may need to raise a ticket, submit a purchase order, request administrative rights, or obtain licences. Practical evidence includes an email exchange requesting software, a screenshot of a purchase confirmation, or a ticket system request.
Examples for this criterion include an email requesting the purchase of antivirus software, a screenshot of an online purchase confirmation for Microsoft Office, and a screenshot of a ticket raised for software installation.
2.3 Select the installation or upgrade procedures to be followed
You should reference company or manufacturer policies, ensure that minimum specification requirements are met, and use internal ticketing with the IT department as needed. Practical evidence includes an email referencing company policy, a screenshot of minimum specifications, or a ticket system screenshot.
Examples include an email referencing the company’s installation policy, a screenshot of minimum specification requirements for software, and a screenshot of an internal ticket raised for an upgrade.
2.4 Select software loading facilities to be used
You must explain your choice of loading facility, such as CD, USB, or download, and reference the installation plan and practical evidence. Your reasoning should consider speed, reliability, and compatibility.
Examples include a screenshot of an installation plan referencing a USB loading facility and a table comparing loading facilities and reasons for your choice.
Templates and Examples
A sample installation plan should include details of the hardware and software to be added, the upgrading procedures, the software loading facilities, data backup, health and safety considerations, authorisation, system integrity and performance checks, company records, error handling, handover to the user, and supervisor verification and sign-off.
A sample risk assessment should identify risks such as data loss, corruption, or downtime, assign likelihood and impact ratings (high, medium, or low), and describe mitigation strategies such as backing up data before installation.
Examples for these templates include a completed installation plan for Windows 10 and a completed risk assessment for Windows 10 installation.
Good Practice
Assignments should use learning outcome titles as section headings, include practical evidence such as emails, screenshots, plans, and risk assessments, use UK English throughout, and ensure that all steps are documented and verified.
