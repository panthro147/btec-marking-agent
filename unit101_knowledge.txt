Unit 101 – Health and Safety in ICT
App-Optimised Knowledge File
Unit summary
This unit covers compliance with health and safety legislation in ICT workplaces. The main law is the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974, which sets out duties for employers and employees to ensure a safe working environment. Other relevant regulations include the Display Screen Equipment Regulations, Manual Handling Operations Regulations, GDPR, Computer Misuse Act, and Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) is the main regulatory body.
Learning Outcome 1 Comply with relevant health and safety procedures
Assessment Criterion 1.1 Identify relevant organisational health and safety procedures
Employers must provide a safe workplace, safe equipment, and proper training. They must carry out risk assessments to identify hazards and take action to reduce risks. Employees must follow procedures, use equipment safely, and report hazards. In ICT, this includes safe use of computers, correct workstation setup, safe manual handling of equipment, and secure handling of data. Examples of procedures include regular equipment checks, PAT testing, clear signage, and mandatory health and safety training. Staff handbooks and company intranets provide details of these procedures. Risk assessments are completed for work areas and tasks, identifying hazards such as loose cables, spills, or heavy lifting. Actions are assigned and tracked to completion.
Assessment Criterion 1.2 Identify available sources of health and safety information
Health and safety information is available from the HSE website, company handbook, and company intranet. Staff can also consult the health and safety officer or occupational health service. Information is displayed on workplace noticeboards and in induction materials. Screenshots or printouts of these sources can be used as evidence. Staff should know how to access these resources and use them to stay informed about procedures and updates.
Assessment Criterion 1.3 Demonstrate how relevant health and safety procedures have been followed
Staff follow procedures by conducting regular checks of equipment and work areas, reporting hazards to managers, and using PPE when required. Evidence includes completed risk assessments, email chains reporting hazards, photos of safety signage, and training certificates. For example, a staff member may report a blocked fire exit or a spill near electronic equipment by email, and follow up to ensure the issue is resolved. Risk assessments should include at least two hazards relevant to ICT, such as loose cabling or manual handling. Staff participate in drills, attend training, and cooperate with colleagues to maintain a safe environment. Personal reflection on these activities is encouraged.
Practical evidence
Include risk assessment templates and completed examples, redacted emails reporting hazards, photos of compliant workspaces and signage, and screenshots of information sources. All evidence should be authentic, current, and relevant to your own workplace or placement.
Reflection
Describe your role in maintaining health and safety, what you learned from reporting hazards or completing risk assessments, and how you keep up to date with procedures. Explain the importance of prompt reporting, clear communication, and following up on actions.
Legislation and procedures
Reference the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974, Display Screen Equipment Regulations, Manual Handling Operations Regulations, GDPR, Computer Misuse Act, and other relevant laws. Explain how these apply to your role and what actions you take to comply.
Assessment and evidence
Assessment is workplace-based and requires practical, authentic evidence for each criterion. Use real examples from your own experience, and ensure all evidence is up to date and relevant.
