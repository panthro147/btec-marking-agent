Unit 101 – Health and Safety in ICT
Knowledge Base for Marking (Comprehensive, Aligned with EV-Passed Assignments and Unit Specification)
1.1 Identify relevant organisational health and safety procedures
The Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 is the main UK legislation for workplace health and safety. It outlines the responsibilities of employers and employees to ensure workplace health, safety, and welfare. Employers must conduct risk assessments to identify hazards and control risks, provide training and information to staff, maintain safe equipment and premises, and provide Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) where necessary. Employees must follow health and safety procedures, use equipment safely, and report hazards and incidents. Other relevant legislation includes the Display Screen Equipment Regulations 1992 for safe computer use and workstation setup, the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999 for risk assessments and training, the Manual Handling Operations Regulations 1992 for safe lifting and moving, GDPR for data protection as part of safe working, the Computer Misuse Act 1990 for IT security, the Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1999 for safe use of equipment, the Electricity at Work Regulations 1991 for safe use of electrical equipment, and the Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 2013 for reporting incidents. These are implemented in the workplace through staff handbooks, induction, mandatory training, signage, and regular audits. Students should provide clear explanations of legislation and procedures, with specific examples from their own workplace.
1.2 Identify available sources of health and safety information
Internal sources include the staff intranet, company handbook, health and safety officer, workplace posters and signage, and online learning portals. Induction and ongoing training sessions are also important. External sources include the Health and Safety Executive website at https://www.hse.gov.uk/, NI Direct for Northern Ireland-specific guidance, and other government and regulatory websites. Evidence of accessing these sources can be provided through screenshots, references, or descriptions. Students should reference both internal and external sources of information.
1.3 Demonstrate how relevant health and safety procedures have been followed
Following company health and safety policy involves conducting regular checks of equipment and workspace, reporting hazards, accidents, or near misses (for example, via email to a manager or using official forms), using personal protective equipment as required, attending training and participating in risk assessments, and cooperating with colleagues and managers on safety matters. Practical evidence includes completed risk assessment tables (with hazards, who might be harmed, controls, further actions, responsible person, deadlines, and completion), photos of compliance such as tidy cables, signage, and safe storage, redacted email communications reporting issues, and examples of improvements made such as fixing loose cables or better housekeeping. Evidence should be specific to the student’s workplace and role.
Marking guidance: Look for clear explanations of legislation and procedures with specific examples from the student’s own workplace. Expect references to both internal and external sources of information. Require practical evidence of following procedures such as risk assessments, photos, and emails. Encourage use of workplace-specific details and personal reflection. Feedback should highlight strengths such as detailed risk assessment and proactive reporting, and suggest improvements such as more evidence or clearer links to legislation.
